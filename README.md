# Hospital-Emergency-Room-dashboard
This dashboard visualizes emergency room patient data, tracking admissions, wait times, satisfaction, demographics, and referrals for improved healthcare efficiency.

# Project Overview
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is a data visualization tool designed to track and monitor patient flow, wait times, admission status, gender distribution, referral departments, and other key performance metrics in emergency room (ER) operations.

By leveraging real-time insights, hospital administrators, healthcare professionals, and decision-makers can optimize resource allocation, reduce patient wait times, improve service efficiency, and enhance overall patient satisfaction.
